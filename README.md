## Install

    pip install measure-noise

## Usage

The `deviance()` method will return a `(description, score)` pair describing how the samples deviate from a normal distribution, and by how much.  This is intended to screen samples for use in the t-test, and other statistics, that assume a normal distribution.

* `SKEWED` - samples are heavily to one side of the mean
* `OUTLIERS` - there are more outliers than would be expected from normal distribution
* `MODAL` - few samples are near the mean (probably bimodal)
* `OK` - no egregious deviation from normal
* `N/A` - not enough data to make a conclusion (aka `OK`)

#### Example

    from measure_noise import deviance

	>>> desc, score = deviance([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8])
    >>> desc
    'OK'

## Development

For Linux/OSX

    git clone https://github.com/mozilla/measure-noise.git
    cd measure-noise
    python -m venv .venv      
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install -r tests/requirements.txt
    export PYTHONPATH=.:vendor
    python -m unittest discover tests 

Similar for Windows:

    git clone https://github.com/mozilla/measure-noise.git
    cd measure-noise
    python -m pip install virtualenv  # venv is buggy on Windows
    python -m virtualenv .venv 
    .venv\Scripts\activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install -r tests\requirements.txt
    set PYTHONPATH=.;vendor
    python -m unittest discover tests 


---------------------

## Analysis Configuration

The analysis requires a connection to a Treeherder database. The `config.json` file points to a `private.json` file with all the secrets:

```javascript
// Example contents of ~/private.json
{
    "treeherder": {
        "host": "treeherder-prod-ro.cd3i3txkp6c6.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
        "port" : 3306,
        "username": "activedata2",
        "password": "password"
    }
}
```

You may make your own copy of the `config.json` with references to wherever your secrets are.  If you put it in `/resources`, then you may make a PR with it. Remember, **never put secrets in your project directory**; use references to secrets instead.   

> You may use `{"$ref":"env://MY_ENV_VARIABLE"}` to use environment variables. [More details](https://github.com/klahnakoski/mo-json-config#environment-variables-reference) 

## Running Analysis

Ensure you are in the main project directory, and point to your config file 

**Linux/OSX**

    export PYTHONPATH=.:vendor
    python measure_noise/analysis.py --config=resources/kyle_config.json

**Windows**

    set PYTHONPATH=.;vendor
    python measure_noise\analysis.py --config=resources\kyle_config.json


Some other options are 

* `--id` - show specific signature_ids
* `--download=<filename>` - Download all deviant statistics to file
* `--deviant=<int>` - Show number of series with most deviant noise 
* `--outliers=<int>` - Show number of series with most outliers noise 
* `--modal=<int>` - Show number of series that seem bi-modal 
* `--skewed=<int>` - Show number of series where mean and median differ 
* `--ok=<int>` - Show number of series that are worst, but good enough 
* `--noise=<int>` - Show number of series with largest relative standard deviation
* `--extra=<int>` - Show number of series where Perfherder has detected steps, but not MWU
* `--missing=<int>` - Show number of series where Perfherder missed alerting

## Post Analysis

The `analysis.py` fills a local Sqlite database (as per the config file). It can be used to lookup other series that may be of interest, or to feed yet-another-program.


## Windows

You must download the `scipy` and `numpy` binary packages.
